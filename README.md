How to Play Chess

Welcome to the Chess game! Here’s a quick guide on how to play:

Starting the Game: When you run the game, you’ll be welcomed and asked if you want to load a saved game. Choose "Y" to load or "N" to start a new game.

Turns: Players alternate turns, starting with White. Each turn, you'll be prompted to enter the origin and destination positions of the piece you want to move (e.g., "D2" to "D4").

Making Moves:

Ensure the origin position contains a piece of your color. The move must be valid according to chess rules. If you successfully capture an opponent's piece, you earn points based on the piece type (e.g., pawn = 1, knight = 3, bishop = 3, rook = 5, queen = 9, king = 0). Invalid Moves: If you attempt an invalid move, you will receive feedback, and you can try again.

Pawn Promotion: If a pawn reaches the opposite end of the board, you will be prompted to promote it to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight.

End of the Game: The game ends when a player declares a winner by capturing the opponent's king or if a player has no pieces left. You can also end the game by entering "END" during your turn.

Saving and Loading: The game can be saved at any point, and you can load your last saved game on startup.

Scores: At the end of each turn, the current scores for both players will be displayed. Players earn points for captured pieces according to the scoring method described above.

Enjoy your game of chess!
